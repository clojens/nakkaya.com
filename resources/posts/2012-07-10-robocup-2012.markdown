Blog has been silent for a while, I've been sleeping in the lab for
the past couple of months trying to get theses little guys working in
time for Robocup 2012.

RoboCup is an international robotics competition founded in
1997. There are three main branches under the name of RoboCup, these
are "Robot Soccer World Cup", "Search and Rescue", and "Robot
Dancing". The main goal of this organization is to build fully
autonomous robots to play against FIFA 2050 World Cup winner and win
the game.

This project started two years ago with us thinking how hard can it
be. Turns out it was hard, took us two years to qualify for the
event. Despite countless electrical problems, (electronics was/is our
weakest spot) we managed to play two out of four games.

Unfortunately we were too busy trying to keep the robots working on
the field, non of us though of recording any game play footage.

For those of you who think talk is cheap, here is our [literate
code](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11332353/neu-islanders.pdf). Its
written in Clojure except for the firmware which is in C.
