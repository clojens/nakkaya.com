#+title: Using Offlineimap with Gnus
#+tags: offlineimap gnus

As I rely more and more on my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G][3G]] connection, its high latency made my
Gnus experience more more unbearable. I wanted to keep using IMAP in
order to use multiple clients while on the go, so I settled on using
[[http://software.complete.org/software/projects/show/offlineimap][OfflineIMAP]]. OfflineIMAP will download all your mail and keep it in
Maildir format any changes Gnus makes will be synchronized back to
GMail and as a bonus you get a backup of all your emails. Even though
both OfflineIMAP and Gnus has been around for years they still don't
play well with each other, Gnus uses its own flags instead of using
standard Maildir flags so your changes aren't synchronized back to
GMail, [[http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.user/msg/7594165a2b6d1c49][someone]] complained about this 6 years ago but sadly nothing has
changed. There is still hope though, using the script he posted with
OfflineIMAP's pre/post hooks we can sync Gnus flags to Maildir and
vice versa.

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  [general]
  ui = Noninteractive.Basic
  accounts = nakkaya
  
  [Account nakkaya]
  localrepository = nakkayaLocal
  remoterepository = nakkayaRemote
  autorefresh = 1
  
  presynchook = ~/Projects/scripts/sync_nnmaildir -g
  postsynchook = ~/Projects/scripts/sync_nnmaildir -m
  
  [Repository nakkayaLocal]
  type = Maildir
  localfolders = ~/Documents/mail/
  
  [Repository nakkayaRemote]
  type = Gmail
  remoteuser = nurullah@nakkaya.com
  remotepass = super_secret_password
  holdconnectionopen = true
  keepalive = 60
  
  #Setting realdelete = yes will Really Delete email from the server.
  #Otherwise "deleting" a message will just remove any labels and 
  #retain the message in the All Mail folder.
  realdelete = no
#+END_SRC

Save this snippet as ".offlineimaprc", change remote repository type to
IMAP if you need to use this with some other IMAP server. Only trick here is
to sync Gnus flags to Maildir before IMAP sync and sync Maildir flags to
Gnus flags after IMAP sync. Now run /offlineimap/ while it
synchronizes your messages open your *~/.gnus* set your select method
to use nnmaildir,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq gnus-select-method 
        '(nnmaildir "GMail" 
                    (directory "~/Documents/mail/")
                    (directory-files nnheader-directory-files-safe) 
                    (get-new-mail nil)))
  
  (define-key gnus-group-mode-map (kbd "vo")
    '(lambda ()
       (interactive)
       (shell-command "offlineimap&" "*offlineimap*" nil)))
#+END_SRC

Now start Gnus, press ^ (gnus-group-enter-server-mode), open
nnimap:GMail, for each folder press u
(gnus-browse-unsubscribe-current-group) to toggle the subscription
status until youâ€™re subscribed to the group. Then it should show up on
the group screen (M-x gnus). This also adds a new key binding to the
group buffer, typing "vo" will start OfflineIMAP.

For sending email using GMail, you need to install gnutls package, then
add the following to your .gnus,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load "tls")
  (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        starttls-use-gnutls t
        starttls-gnutls-program "/opt/local/bin/gnutls-cli"
        starttls-extra-arguments nil      
        smtpmail-gnutls-credentials
        '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 nil nil))
        ;; smtpmail-auth-credentials
        ;;'(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 "nurullah@nakkaya.com" "pass" ))
        smtpmail-starttls-credentials 
        '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 "nurullah@nakkaya.com" nil))
        smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-service 587
        smtpmail-debug-info t
        smtpmail-local-domain "nakkaya.com")
#+END_SRC

You also need a .netrc file in your home directory with the following
content,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  machine smtp.gmail.com login nurullah@nakkaya.com password pass port 587
#+END_EXAMPLE

With this setup you should be able to send and receive email. This setup
isn't perfect, an OS X bug makes OfflineIMAP crash while trying to download
large emails, also it does crash every 10 hours or so but I can live
with that, on the plus side it makes Gnus blazing fast.
